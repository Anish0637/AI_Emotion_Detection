# AI Emotion Recognition
## Spring 2020 AI project

### Basic Emotions, Paul Ekman 
- https://drive.google.com/open?id=142GhLrr6pMwemVCF0R3WHJacOR2TIVAJ

Ekman and Friesen identified six basic emotions based on studying the isolated culture of people from the Fori tribe in Papua New Guinea in 1972. The tribe members were able to identify these six emotions on the pictures.
After that, they took pictures of facial expressions of people from the Fori tribe with the same emotions and they presented these pictures to people of other races and cultures all over the world. They also interpreted the emotions on the pictures correctly.
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Surprise

### Dataset
Interspeech Computational Paralinguistics Challenge (ComParE)

- The INTERSPEECH 2020 Computational Paralinguistics ChallengE (ComParE) is an open Challenge dealing with states and traits of speakers as manifested in their speech signal’s properties. http://www.compare.openaudio.eu/data/
The SEWA Database

- A database of annotated audio and 2D visual dynamic behaviour (recorded by standard webcams used by the volunteers) has been collected within the SEWA project. https://db.sewaproject.eu/
Cohn-Kanade (CK and CK+) database. 

- Datasets for training affect recognition and for perception studies. RGB Video http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/
AFEW

- Acted Facial Expressions In The Wild is a dynamic temporal facial expressions data corpus consisting of close to real world environment extracted from movies. https://cs.anu.edu.au/few/AFEW.html
RAVDESS

- The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.XlSgTChKhpg
DISFA

- Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action Database is a non-posed facial expression database for those who are interested in developing computer algorithms for automatic action unit detection and their intensities described by FACS. https://web.archive.org/web/20151024114056/http://www.engr.du.edu/mmahoor/DISFA.htm
The MUG Facial Expression Database

- The MUG database was created by the Multimedia Understanding Group. It was created to overcome some limitations of the other similar databases that preexisted at that time, such as high resolution, uniform lighting, many subjects and many takes per subject. https://mug.ee.auth.gr/fed/ 
RaFD

- The Radboud Faces Database is a set of pictures of 67 models (including Caucasian males and females, Caucasian children, both boys and girls, and Moroccan Dutch males) displaying 8 emotional expressions. http://www.socsci.ru.nl:8180/RaFD2/RaFD
MMI 

- Facial Expression Database https://mmifacedb.eu/
AffectNet

- Existing annotated databases of facial expressions in the wild are small and mostly cover discrete emotions (aka the categorical model). There are very limited annotated facial databases for affective computing in the continuous dimensional model (e.g., valence and arousal). http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/
FER+ 

- new label annotations for the Emotion FER dataset. (Paper) https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01041 (Images) https://github.com/microsoft/FERPlus
iBug

- These data are in accordance with the paper Deep Affect Prediction in-the-wild: Aff-Wild Database and Challenge, Deep Architectures, and Beyond.
