### Basic Emotions, Paul Ekman 
________________________________________

Ekman and Friesen identified six basic emotions based on studying the isolated culture of people from the Fori tribe in Papua New Guinea in 1972. The tribe members were able to identify these six emotions on the pictures.

- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Surprise
